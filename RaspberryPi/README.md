LockIt! is an Internet of Things proyect that uses the ESP8266 microcontroller and the RaspberryPi to "smarify" yout front door, allowing you to monitor it in realtime as well as keep a log of when the door is open (day and exact time). Aditionally, it also allows the user to unlock the door using facial recognition.
